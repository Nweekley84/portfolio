# portfolio
#### By Nathan Weekley
A portfolio of samples of my projects for potential employers.

## Technologies Used
* Github
* VSCode
* Terminal
* Google "inspect"
* html
* Css

## Desciption
A barebones portfolio page that will eventually be populated with all of my class projects. Additionally the CSS and flexbox code will ultimatly be updated as well as the overall design as my skills continue to develope throughout the course. It looks rough right now I know, but it will improve with time. Screenshot of site is located under ./assets/images/portfolioSC_files/IMG_1818.JPEG

## Setup/Installation Requirements
N/A

## Known Bugs
Still trying to figure out flexbox code mainly flex-wrap, so upon resizing from different screen sizes, all rows appear on their correct locations. Also still need to figure out how to add a "subtitle" within the header with it's own custom bakground image as per the example. Work section is vacant as this is the only project I have to show for so far. Also need to add RIGHT sided border (only) to each "assets" bar IE: About Me, Work, Contact. Title background "Nathan Weekley" in header needs the background color extended all the way left with 0 padding.
